# Mechatronics-2-S2020

Mechatronics 2 was to use an Arduino UNO and program ATmega328P directly by using limited amount of functions given by the standard arduino IDE library. 

Assessment2.ino is to set up delays using interrupts, to run a 5V DC stepper motor and an IR sensor all connected to Arduino UNO.

Assessment3.ino uses a (given) MATLAB simulation of a maze rover, that searches and approaches the goal by randomly moving around the space without collision. The MATLAB simulation communicates with the Arduino UNO through USB port.

Assessment4.ino is an extension of assessment3 where the rover must now find the water (goal 1) to put out the fire (goal 2), before returning to the original position.

For assessment3 and assessment4, the MATLAB file is provided with MazeColliders_User_Guide.pdf  and use LCD â€“ DFROBOT LCD Keypad Shield V1.1 for Arduino UNO
